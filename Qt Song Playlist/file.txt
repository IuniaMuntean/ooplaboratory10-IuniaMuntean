"
We took a walk that night, but it wasn't the same 
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain 
She said she loved me, but she had somewhere to go 
She couldn't scream while I held her close 
I swore I'd never let her go 
Tell me what you want to know 
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on 
There ain't no motive for this crime 
Jenny was a friend of mine 
So come on, so come on, so come on 
Come on! 
I know my rights, I've been here all day and it's time 
For me to go, so let me know if it's alright 
I just can't take this, I swear I told you the truth 
She couldn't scream while I held her close 
I swore I'd never let her go 
Tell me what you want to know 
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on 
And then you whisper in my ear 
I know what you're doing here 
So come on, oh come on, oh come on 
There ain't no motive for this crime 
Jenny was a friend of mine 
So come on, oh come on, oh come on 
Tell me what you want to know 
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on 
There ain't no motive for this crime 
Jenny was a friend of mine 
So come on, oh come on, oh come on 
Come on! 
Oh come on! 
Oh come on! 
Oh come on!

We'll never get free 
Lamb to the slaughter 
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water? 
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter 
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water? 
Look me in my eyes 
Tell me everything's not fine 
Oh, the people ain't happy 
And the river has run dry 
You thought you could go free 
But the system is done for 
If you listen real closely 
There's a knock at your front door 
We'll never get free 
Lamb to the slaughter 
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water? 
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter 
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water? 
When there's blood in the 
(Uh, uh) 
When there's blood in the 
(Uh, uh) 
Beg me for mercy 
Admit you were toxic 
You poisoned me just for 
Another dollar in your pocket 
Now I am the violence 
I am the sickness 
Won't accept your silence 
Beg me for forgiveness 
We'll never get free 
Lamb to the slaughter 
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water? 
The price of your greed, your son and your daughter 
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water? 
When there's blood in the water 
(Uh, uh) 
When there's blood in the 
(Uh, uh) 
I am the people 
I am the storm 
I am the riot 
I am the swarm 
When the last tree's fallen the animal can't hide 
Money won't solve it 
What's your alibi? 
What's your alibi? 
What's your alibi? 
What you gon' do when there's blood in the, blood in the water? 
When there's blood in the water 
(Uh, uh) 
When there's blood in the 
(Uh, uh) 
When there's blood in the water

All my friends are heathens, take it slow 
Wait for them to ask you who you know 
Please don't make any sudden moves 
You don't know the half of the abuse 
All my friends are heathens, take it slow 
Wait for them to ask you who you know 
Please don't make any sudden moves 
You don't know the half of the abuse 
Welcome to the room of people 
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day 
Docked away 
Just because we check the guns at the door 
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades 
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you 
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you 
You'll think, How'd I get here, sitting next to you? 
But after all I've said, please don't forget 
All my friends are heathens, take it slow 
Wait for them to ask you who you know 
Please don't make any sudden moves 
You don't know the half of the abuse 
We don't deal with outsiders very well 
They say newcomers have a certain smell 
You have trust issues, not to mention 
They say they can smell your intentions 
You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you 
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you 
You'll think How did I get here, sitting next to you? 
But after all I've said, please don't forget 
All my friends are heathens, take it slow 
Wait for them to ask you who you know 
Please don't make any sudden moves 
You don't know the half of the abuse 
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (watch it) 
Wait for them to ask you who you know (watch it) 
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (watch it) 
Wait for them to ask you who you know 
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed 
I tried to warn you just to stay away 
And now they're outside ready to bust 
It looks like you might be one of us

So where are you? It's been a little while 
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me 
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical 
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete 
The moment is medical, moment is medical 
Sippin' on straight chlorine 
Lovin' what I'm tastin' 
Venom on my tongue 
Dependant at times 
Poisonous vibration 
Help my body run 
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe 
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe 
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me 
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical 
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete 
The moment is medical, moment is medical 
Sippin' on straight chlorine 
Fall out of formation 
I plan my escape from walls they confined 
Rebel red carnation 
Grows while I decay 
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe 
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe 
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe 
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe 
Had you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red 
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head 
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead 
The last two lines may read incorrect until said 
The lead is terrible in flavor 
But now you double as a papermaker 
I despise you sometimes 
I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like 
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me 
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical 
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete 
The moment is medical, moment is medical 
Sippin' on straight chlorine 
Let the vibe, let the vibe 
Let the vibe, let the vibe 
Beat is a chemical, yeah 
Let the vibe, let the vibe 
Let the vibe, let the vibe 
Moment is medical, yeah 
Sippin' on straight chlorine 
Let the vibe, let the vibe 
Let the vibe, let the vibe 
Beat is a chemical, yeah 
Let the vibe, let the vibe 
Let the vibe, let the vibe 
Moment is medical, yeah 
I'm so sorry, I forgot you 
Let me catch you up to speed 
I've been tested like the ends of 
A weathered flag that's by the sea 
Can you build my house with pieces? 
I'm just a chemical 
Can you build my house with pieces? 
I'm just a chemical 
Can you build my house with pieces? 
I'm just a chemical 
Can you build my house with pieces? 
I'm just a chemical

Now everybody come to the dance floor 
I don't need a pistol 
Give me the mic and then a pencil 
Bristle is my lifetime momentous 
Oh, yes I'm doing pretty well these days 
But I'll be there when you're scared eating pills in everyday 
If you die so am I 
Let's go heaven and say hi 
Brothers and sisters and teachers now thank you for nice, kind time 
I might not like you guys

ZITTI E BUONI

Loro non sanno di che parlo 
Vestiti sporchi, fra', di fango 
Giallo di siga fra le dita 
Io con la siga camminando 
Scusami ma ci credo tanto 
Che posso fare questo salto 
E anche se la strada è in salita 
Per questo ora mi sto allenando 
E buonasera signore e signori 
Fuori gli attori 
Vi conviene toccarvi i coglioni 
Vi conviene stare zitti e buoni 
Qui la gente è strana, tipo spacciatori 
Troppe notti stavo chiuso fuori 
Mo li prendo a calci 'sti portoni 
Sguardo in alto tipo scalatori 
Quindi scusa mamma se sto sempre fuori ma 
Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro 
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro 
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro 
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro, no 
Io ho scritto pagine e pagine, ho visto sale poi lacrime 
Questi uomini in macchina non scalare le rapide 
Scritto sopra una lapide, in casa mia non c'è Dio 
Ma se trovi il senso del tempo risalirai dal tuo oblio 
E non c'è vento che fermi la naturale potenza 
Dal punto giusto di vista, del vento senti l'ebrezza 
Con ali in cera alla schiena ricercherò quell'altezza 
Se vuoi fermarmi ritenta, prova a tagliarmi la testa perché 
Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro 
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro 
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro 
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro, oh 
Mmm, parla, la gente purtroppo parla 
Non sa di che cosa parla 
Tu portami dove sto a galla 
Che qui mi manca l'aria 
Parla, la gente purtroppo parla 
Non sa di che cosa parla 
Tu portami dove sto a galla 
Che qui mi manca l'aria 
Parla, la gente purtroppo parla 
Non sa di che cazzo parla 
Tu portami dove sto a galla 
Che qui mi manca l'aria 
Ma sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro 
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro 
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro 
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro, ah 
Noi siamo diversi da loro
